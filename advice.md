# ✅ YouTube Automation Bot – Pro Tips

These best practices will help keep the bot stealthy, stable, and scalable when using Node.js, Puppeteer, and GoLogin.

---

## 🧠 1. Rotate Everything per Profile

- ✅ Use GoLogin's built-in proxy (`"proxy.mode": "gologin"`)
- ✅ Let GoLogin assign user-agent, fingerprint, timezone, OS
- ✅ Each Gmail = 1 unique GoLogin profile

---

## 🐢 2. Simulate Human Behavior

- Use realistic delays:
  ```js
  await page.type('input', 'text', { delay: 120 });
  ```
- Use [`ghost-cursor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor) to simulate real mouse movement
- Avoid clicking exact pixel centers — randomize slightly

---

## 🔐 3. Handle CAPTCHAs Smartly

- Log every CAPTCHA hit and take a screenshot
- Integrate 2Captcha or CapMonster for solving (optional)
- Avoid CAPTCHAs by:
  - Typing slowly
  - Moving mouse smoothly
  - Not looping profiles too quickly

---

## 🔁 4. Add Retry and Recovery

Wrap critical steps in try/catch:
```js
try {
  await loginToGmail();
} catch (e) {
  logError(e);
  continue; // skip to next Gmail
}
```

---

## 📄 5. Log Everything

Log progress per profile:
```
/logs/profile-123.json
{
  gmail: "example@gmail.com",
  firstChannelDone: true,
  secondChannelDone: false,
  uploaded: [ "1.mp4", "2.mp4" ]
}
```

---

## 📦 6. Organize Videos by Gmail

```
/videos/gmail1/
  - 1.mp4
  - 2.mp4
  - 3.mp4
  - metadata.json
```

Include title, desc, tags in `metadata.json`.

---

## 🧊 7. Don’t Overload

- Wait 5–10 mins between profiles
- Don’t upload too quickly
- Use delays and randomization

---

## 🚨 8. Start Small

- Test the full flow with 1 Gmail account first
- Ensure login, channel creation, and video uploads work
- Scale only after validation

---

## 📛 9. Respect YouTube Limits

- Max 15–20 videos/day/channel (especially new ones)
- Don’t upload the same video multiple times
- Keep metadata unique to avoid spam detection
